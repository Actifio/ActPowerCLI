# Changelog
All notable changes to ActPowerCLI will be documented in this file

## [10.0.1.18] 2020-06-20
No functional changes.  This version is uploaded to PSGallery: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ActPowerCLI

## [10.0.1.17] 2020-06-19
Because report commands do not load as functions until after Connect-Act, this causes confusion.   Added reportlist as a discreet function to give useful error message.

All error messages that are locally generated will use the same format as appliance generated, making the behaviour more consistent and scriptable.
